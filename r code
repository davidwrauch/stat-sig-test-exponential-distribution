#csv should be 10,000 records of control variable in question, exponentially or non-normally distributed

file$variableVector <- as.vector(unlist(file$`variable`))
#you have to turn the 10K examples into a vector

y <- file$variableVector*1.05 
# y is your expected relative improvement of the variant vs the control, this example is a 5% relative improvement
samplesize <- WMWssp(file$variableVector, y, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, t = .5, simulation = FALSE, nsim = 10^4)
#alpha is the two sided type I error rate, usually .05
# Power we usually keep at .8
#t is the split of A-B, .5 means a 50-50 split of A to B
# keep simulation and nsim at the settings listed above
samplesize
#first group is the control, second group is the variant. Use these values to determine how long you need to run your experiment
